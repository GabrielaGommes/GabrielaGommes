- I am 5 years in the corporate world, I migrated from the administrative area to the Human Resources area through the Psychology course to help people and impact their lives in a positive way, because that's what I love to do! I have been in the Human Resources area for 1 year and today my focus is Talent Acquisition within the Recruitment and Selection and People and Culture area. <3
